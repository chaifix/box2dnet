Box2D.Net
=============

Hello anyone. This is plain port of JBox2D to .Net
This is converted using JLCA Java to C# code converter which you can find in Visual Studio 2005

Now we need to fix all converting issues (there are not so much of them) and run it.

Main goal for me to do it is to get .Net version of Box2D which doesn't depend on XNA or other frameworks.
It will be better to call this project Plain Box2D.Net :)

Feel free to contribute.
